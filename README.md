1. Introduction
The Snake Game is a simple yet addictive arcade game where the player controls a snake and attempts to eat food placed on the game board. As the snake consumes food, it grows in length, making the game more challenging. The game ends when the snake collides with the game board's boundaries or its own tail.

The game is written in Python and can be run on any system that supports Python.

2. Game Rules
The snake moves continuously in a specified direction.
The player can control the snake's direction using arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
The snake can eat the food on the game board to grow in length.
The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries of the game board or its own tail.

3. Installation
   To run the Snake Game on your local machine, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Python installed. If not, download and install Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/).

Clone the repository or download the source code as a ZIP file:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game.git

Change into the project directory:
cd snake-game

4. Controls
The game can be controlled using the arrow keys on your keyboard:

Up Arrow: Move the snake upwards.
Down Arrow: Move the snake downwards.
Left Arrow: Move the snake to the left.
Right Arrow: Move the snake to the right.
'Q' Key: Quit the game.

5. How to Play
Start the game by running the Python script:
python snake_game.py

The snake will start moving automatically. Control the snake's direction using the arrow keys.

Guide the snake to eat the food ('F') on the game board. Each time the snake eats the food, its length will increase.

Avoid colliding with the boundaries of the game board or the snake's own tail. Collisions will end the game.

Keep playing and try to achieve the highest score possible!
